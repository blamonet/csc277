CSC 277 - Assembly Language

This is probably one of the classes that I had the most difficulty with... Mostly because I didn't see a point (I was interested in higher level languages and who cares about registries?! pfftt). Anyways young me didn't see a point and I took this class twice to get a decent grade. Luckily for me, after this course I never had to touch assembly again, good for the world and me. ;)
